# Created by Keaton Dove, 2022

# This project is a work in progress.

    'AngularSocialMedia' does not have any particular direction, inspiration, or real-world functionality. The purpose of this project is to serve as a learning device for me to
    learn front-end web development. The plan is to create a simple social media/blog website using Angular version 13.

        Functionalities will include: 
            Viewing posts from other users without signing in,
            Creaing a user account,
            Making a text based post,
            Commenting on posts,
            Navigating between pages (intuitive user interface)

            Potential work after app is functional:
                Integrate MySQL as app's backend,
                Perform CRUD operations using MySQL
