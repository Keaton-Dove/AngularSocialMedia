# This project is in an alpha stage.

    'AngularSocialMedia' does not have any particular direction or inspiration. The purpose of this project is to serve as a learning device for me to
    learn front-end web development and TypeScript. This project is a minimum viable product social media/blog website built using Angular version 13.

        Basic Functionalities include: 
            Viewing posts from other users without signing in,
            Creaing a user account,
            Making a text based post,
            Navigating between pages (intuitive user interface)

        Future work:
            Ability to save or comment on posts,
            Profile pages,
            Additional feeds for saved posts and catered content,
            Integrate MySQL for data management,
            Perform CRUD operations using MySQL,
            User authentication via SQL lookup
