# This project is a work in progress.

    'AngularSocialMedia' does not have any particular direction or inspiration. The purpose of this project is to serve as a learning device for me to
    learn front-end web development. The plan is to create a simple social media/blog website using Angular version 13.

        Basic Functionalities will include: 
            Viewing posts from other users without signing in,
            Creaing a user account,
            Making a text based post,
            Commenting on posts,
            Navigating between pages (intuitive user interface)

        Potential work after app is functional:
            Integrate MySQL for data management,
            Perform CRUD operations using MySQL
