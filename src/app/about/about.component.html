        <h3>This project is in an alpha stage.</h3>

        <p> 'AngularSocialMedia' does not have any particular direction or inspiration. The purpose of this
             project is to serve as a learning device for me to learn front-end web development and TypeScript. 
             This project is a minimum viable product social media/blog website built using Angular version 13. 
        </p>

        <p> Basic Functionalities will include: 
            <li>Viewing posts from other users without signing in</li>
            <li>Creaing a user account</li>
            <li>Making a text based post</li>
            <li>Navigating between pages (intuitive user interface)</li>
        </p>
        <p> Future work:
            <li>Ability to save or comment on posts </li>
            <li>Profile pages </li>
            <li>Additional feeds for saved posts and catered content </li>
