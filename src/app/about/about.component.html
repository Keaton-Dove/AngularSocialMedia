<h2>Created by Keaton Dove, 2022</h2>


<h3>This project is a work in progress.</h3>

<p> 'AngularSocialMedia' does not have any particular direction, inspiration, or real-world functionality. 
    The purpose of this project is to serve as a learning device for me to learn front-end web development. 
    The plan is to create a simple social media/blog website using Angular version 13. </p>

<p> Functionalities will include: 
    <li>Viewing posts from other users without signing in</li>
    <li>Creaing a user account</li>
    <li>Making a text based post</li>
    <li>Commenting on posts</li> 
    <li>    Navigating between pages (intuitive user interface)</li>
</p>


<p> Potential work after app is functional:
    <li>Integrate MySQL as app's backend </li>
    <li>Perform CRUD operations using MySQL</li>
</p>
